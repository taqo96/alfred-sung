		<p class="designer-article">“Design is a lifetime pursuit and a great passion of mine. I love creating timeless fashions,” says Alfred Sung who has a special passion and talent for design.

		<br><br>

		For more than 35 years, he has created, marketed and merchandised fashionable and sophisticated apparel, home fashion, fragrance and accessories. Together with his founding partners, Mimran Group Inc. and family of licensees, the ALFRED SUNG brand has attained iconic status in Canada.

		<br><br> 

		Shanghai-born, Alfred's life has been an international odyssey in search of design inspiration: Paris, New York, Toronto and Hong Kong all have special meaning for him and have strongly influenced his multi-faceted creativity. Over the years ALFRED SUNG has become synonymous with clean, classic, elegant and thoughtful aesthetics rooted in the brand’s DNA.

		<br><br>

		This aesthetic mastery forms the basis of his ability to design for a broad range of products, which appear in a wide variety of retailers from high-end department, and specialty stores to mass merchants. Always excited about the next project, Alfred remains at the top of his game.</p>
